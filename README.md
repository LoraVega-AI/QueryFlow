QueryFlow - Collaborative Database Platform

QueryFlow is an open-source visual database platform for modern developers. It combines schema design, real-time collaboration, cloud connectivity, and query optimization in one place. Built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, it provides a smooth workflow for database design and data management.

🚀 Quick Start
Requirements

Node.js 18+

npm or yarn

Modern browser with WebAssembly

Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QueryFlow.git
cd QueryFlow
npm install
npm run dev


Then open http://localhost:3000
.

🛠️ Development

Scripts:

# Dev server
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Start production
npm start

# Lint
npm run lint

# Type check
npm run type-check

# Tests
npm test


Code layout:

src/components/ → UI components (SchemaDesigner, QueryRunner, etc.)

src/services/ → database connections, import/export, validation

src/types/ → shared TypeScript types

src/utils/ → helper functions

🌍 Configuration

Environment variables (example):

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/queryflow
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
JWT_SECRET=your_secret
